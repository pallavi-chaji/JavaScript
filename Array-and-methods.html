        console.log(name.slice(1,3));//1 is the index value and 3 is the number based value soo up to 3 number based it will take in the array like malli soo output will be ['nandi','malli']
        console.log(name); //common array will come means slice method not disturb the original array
        
        //in slice method 2 parameters 1st is index value and 2nd is number based value which u want to make it a new array
              
        console.log(name.slice(1,4,));//['nandi','malli','chinna']
        console.log(name.slice(0,2,));//['pallavi','nandi'] here 0 means index value soo starts with pallavi ends to 2 number here upto 2 number based is nandi
        console.log(name.slice(0,4,));//['pallav','nandi','malli','chinna']

        //7:join():convert array in to a string
        console.log(name.join());

        //8.includes(): to check an element is available or not
        console.log(name.includes('pallavi'));//true bcoz pallavi is present
        console.log(name.includes('ajji'));//false
